# Discord command registration while idle

Command registration uses the shared delivery coordinator and existing saved
registration deadlines. It no longer runs as a side effect of the recurring
Gateway runtime reconciliation. Foreground configure and resume still attempt
registration immediately under their existing credential lease.

## Existing obligations and authority

The registration store owns `chat_actions` records of kind
`discord_command_registration`. The existing `chat_discord_command_owners` table
retains the application namespace owner even after endpoint or company deletion.
No table, trigger, listener connection, or private timer is added.

A valid successful receipt has a five-minute remote verification deadline. Other
saved outcomes retain their existing retryAt, including Retry-After. An indefinite
retry remains parked. A genuinely unowned namespace is immediately due. Invalid
receipts, foreign owners, and orphaned ownership tombstones do not become new
registration work. The deadline reader is only a hint; the existing protocol still
checks authority, generation, credentials, identity, and receipt state before
provider operations and commits. An uncertain create is recovered by reading
remote state, never by blindly repeating a create.

Eligible endpoints are Discord, verifying/active/attention, with an active enabled
connection and a known bot/application ID and guild ID. Attention plus failed
connection health remains excluded. These are the old runtime discovery filters;
company status and unrelated endpoint metadata do not add new policy.

## Scheduling and lifecycle

Startup reconstructs eligible state in UUID keyset pages of 100. Committed hints
refresh only the affected endpoint, connection, or deleted company. Refresh and
retry passes have a 30-second minimum spacing when no already-due backlog
remains. A bounded batch with more due rows continues after one second. There is no periodic inventory
scan after all hints settle. Due dispatch rechecks persisted eligibility and the
saved deadline, invokes the command owner, and reloads its durable result.

Each pass admits at most 25 commands, taking turns across companies and preserving
oldest-first order within each company. A company cursor rotates between passes,
including when more companies are due than fit in one pass. A failed or no-progress
attempt backs off from 30 seconds to five minutes; a future stored deadline wins.
A returned promise alone does not prove registration settled.

Dirty scopes received during work remain pending. Drain and warm standby retain
requests without passive SQL. Discovery checks cancellation between rows/pages.
Shutdown stops the coordinator before the chat service and joins an already
admitted provider operation through settlement. A local Gateway is refreshed
through its existing owner after command work; command failure does not replace
or tear down a healthy listener.

## Producer coverage

| Producer | Wake contract |
| --- | --- |
| Registration store | Register intent before initial owner/action insert, state/receipt transitions, and retry-result updates in their existing transaction |
| Configure, reconnect, resume, pause, remove | Existing endpoint-work helper now also signals command scheduling by connection ID |
| Setup test completion | The same endpoint-work helper covers activation |
| Credential reference publication/removal | Signal before binding and reference writes, while retaining the credential lease |
| Gateway connecting, ready, availability and failure callbacks | Scoped endpoint signal when health/status can change eligibility; existing runtime generation fences remain |
| Provider availability reconciliation | Signal available/restored and disabled/removed endpoints |
| Provider-effect, publication and interaction failures | Signal before endpoint attention and failed-health writes |
| Accepted inbound task mutation | Signal the endpoint before its status/connection activation writes; message metadata-only writers stay exempt |
| Generic tool connection API | Existing chat connection transaction helper covers enable/disable and credential/configuration changes |
| Generic connection removal | Signal the SDK connection before archival |
| Generic manual health observation | Chat-owned dispatcher signals SDK connections; other transports do not wake this worker |
| Membership/credential revocation | SDK connections signal before reference removal or disablement |
| Company deletion | Signal the company before the company cascade; namespace tombstones survive |

Draft endpoint creation has no eligible identity and waits for configuration.
Endpoint display names, reach preferences, resource metadata, publication/event
timestamps, and capability-only runtime projection do not create a registration
obligation. Other providers' setup, OAuth, and registration protocols do not
become Discord work. Direct SQL and independent writers still require explicit
wake integration; process-local hints are not cross-replica notification delivery.

## Verification and limits

Selected local verification covers 40 real-PostgreSQL protocol/lifecycle cases,
three fair-batch cases, 93 Discord integration cases, 487 tool-access/access
consumers, and 20 chat-worker/startup consumers: 643 unique tests. Workspace
typechecking and build pass; the final small fairness addition also receives
server type/build verification before publication. The full local `pnpm test:run`
is not claimed: embedded PostgreSQL is unavailable on this host. Remote CI must
complete the full matrix before acceptance.

The large-backlog fairness regression failed before selection was repaired.
Other observed failures were fixture issues: duplicate live-bot IDs, uncertain
transactions retained by prior fault tests, installing a fake clock after creating
a real timer, pausing a connection still in setup, and removing a fixture twice.
Repeated broad runs on a reused database also found an unchanged hard-coded bot
ID and a global comment-body assertion reading earlier fixtures. The final broad
Discord run uses a fresh schema-only disposable database and passes all 91 cases;
production constraints and the unrelated assertions were not relaxed. See the
[dated audit](plans/2026-10-25-discord-command-registration-sleep-audit.md).

This migration proves the command worker's quiet periods. Runtime inventory,
receipt-to-runtime projection, active Gateway lease renewal, persistent sockets,
voice, Teams, and other chat maintenance remain separate obligations. The remaining
runtime poll can still read command receipts; it no longer initiates command
registration or remote verification. Cloud sleep eligibility and durable alarm
coverage are unchanged. A timer in this process cannot wake a stopped host.


Review follow-up: a 300-command regression failed under the old 25-per-30-second
limit. Bounded one-second continuations now drain the controlled due backlog
within 15 seconds, then remain quiet until real verification deadlines. An unknown
scope hint also reproduced loss of a later valid wake. Parsing now occurs inside
the recovery boundary; an invalid scope requests full reconstruction rather than
dropping queued scopes or retrying a poison hint forever. Both regressions and
all 62 combined command/health/batching cases pass.

The real producer integration covers credential rotation and company deletion in
addition to configure/removal. The deletion test first lacked a configured agent
lifecycle worker; after adding the controlled host driver it exposed an existing
restrictive endpoint-to-agent foreign key failure. Prerequisite #17561 fixes the
deletion order in its own PR. The command intent is now registered before endpoint
cleanup in the owning transaction. The test verifies deadline cancellation, SQL
silence, and retained ownership tombstones. All seven automatic-registration
integration cases pass; 1,413 deselected cases are not counted as executed.

A test invocation during prerequisite merging failed before execution because an
import conflict was unresolved. The conflict was repaired preserving both imports,
then the test ran successfully. Final server typecheck/build pass. Fresh CI and
reviews are still required after publication; prior-head Greptile 5/5 and Actions
results do not establish acceptance of this head.


The prerequisite's history review moved cleanup ahead of issue deletion as well.
The dependent signal moves with it, before the first endpoint delete. All seven
producer integrations and six expanded deletion cases pass after propagation;
rollback restores conversation/publication history. The finding remains recorded
in the prerequisite document rather than treating the earlier endpoint-only
fixture as sufficient evidence.
